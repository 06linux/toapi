A Toapi app is a flask app. So you can deploy it as follows:


> While lightweight and easy to use, Flask’s built-in server is not suitable for production as it doesn’t scale well and by default serves only one request at a time. Some of the options available for properly running Flask in production are documented here.

> If you want to deploy your Flask application to a WSGI server not listed here, look up the server documentation about how to use a WSGI app with it. Just remember that your Flask application object is the actual WSGI application.
