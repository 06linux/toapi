## Toapi released! You will never lack of data source!

#### Brief Introduction

Do you have such a demand, have a good idea,
but do not have a good source of data,
it is not easy to find a relevant data sources website,
but found no API (yes but there may be fees),

What it looks like?

```json
// http://127.0.0.1:5000/pic/?q=coffee

{
    "Pixabay": [
        {
            "img": "https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/06/21/05/28/coffee-2426110__340.png"
        },
        {
            "img": "/static/img/blank.gif"
        }
    ],
    "Pexels": [
        {
            "img": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/302899/pexels-photo-302899.jpeg?h=350&auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb"
        },
        {
            "img": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/34085/pexels-photo.jpg?h=350&auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb"
        }
    ]
}
```
